00:00:00.401 --> 00:00:02.603
What is library anxiety?

00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:04.838
According to Washington State University,

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:06.965
Library anxiety is defined as 

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:08.841
"Fear of both the library space, 

00:00:08.841 --> 00:00:12.545
which can be seen as overwhelming and confusing, and of the process

00:00:12.545 --> 00:00:15.161
of using the library to find materials."

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.179
So where does it come from?

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:22.018
There are a lot of things that can cause library anxiety in a student or a library patron

00:00:22.018 --> 00:00:24.018
Some of these can include: Social fears

00:00:24.018 --> 00:00:26.018
Or generalized anxiety

00:00:26.018 --> 00:00:29.957
Misplaced expectations about what you should know,

00:00:29.957 --> 00:00:33.026
Intimidation about the billions of sources out there,

00:00:33.026 --> 00:00:36.029
Or simply, unfamiliarity with the library environment

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:39.532
whether for your specific library, or in general.

00:00:39.532 --> 00:00:41.532
Unfortunately, because everyone is unique in their

00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:43.532
situations and concerns, There is

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:45.532
no immediate cure-all for these anxieties

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:48.505
but there are some things you can keep in mind if they apply to you.

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.376
Or, if you are a librarian trying to combat

00:00:50.376 --> 00:00:52.881
library anxiety in your patrons or students,

00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.881
These tips are for you, too.

00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:58.013
Firstly, library anxiety is extremely common

00:00:58.013 --> 00:01:00.013
especially in academic libraries

00:01:00.013 --> 00:01:03.017
so, you are not alone in feeling this way if you do.

00:01:03.017 --> 00:01:06.019
The average library user is not a library professional,

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:08.466
Therefore, you should never feel like you need to figure

00:01:08.466 --> 00:01:10.466
it out alone, and no one expects you to!

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.025
For librarians, try finding ways to ensure that

00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:15.093
users understand that you are there to help them

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:17.695
and that there are no stupid questions.

00:01:17.695 --> 00:01:19.863
If you're worried about asking in person,

00:01:19.863 --> 00:01:22.032
consider using the library's digital resources

00:01:22.032 --> 00:01:25.501
Or scheduling one-on-one assistance if your library offers it

00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:28.003
For librarians, make sure that if you offer a service

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.505
like this, that it is advertised prominently within the

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:34.000
library, on the academic campus, or on a website

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.009
so patrons can see it.

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:40.012
Again, there is no swift solution for library anxiety,

00:01:40.012 --> 00:01:43.015
but being aware of its existence is a huge step forward

00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:46.017
for any working librarian-user relationship

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.819
Let's keep finding ways to make the research experience

00:01:48.827 --> 00:01:51.021
the best that it can be!
