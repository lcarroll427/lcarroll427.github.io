        <p>Dear Kenton United Methodist Church,</p>
        <div>
            <p>I hope this finds you well. My name is Leanna Carroll and I am currently studying for my Master of Library and Information Science Degree at the University of Denver. In my coursework, I have been taught the importance of digital accessibility and some information on how to ensure that web content is accessible for people with disabilities. Every person should have access to the same information as anyone else, and therefore it is the duty of web content managers for organizations, big and small, to do the utmost to ensure that they are taking steps toward this goal.</p>
            <p>To put my knowledge in practice, I have consulted with guidelines from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/">Web Accessibility Initiative</a> to perform an accessibility report of your website, https://www.kentonumc.org/. Note that this report is meant only to assist you and is as much intended for your benefit as well as those in your community who benefit from proper web accessibility.</p>
            <p>Overall, your website is <strong>very close</strong> to meeting WAI guidelines. This is an excellent place to start! However, there are still a few issues to address. The full report is as follows:</p>

        <h2>Website Page Title</h2>
            <p>When a screen reader reads a web page, the first thing it will read is the page title. These titles are important for easy navigation between tabs in their browser.</p>
            <p><strong>Results:</strong>Each page of this site begins with a clear HTML title.</p>
